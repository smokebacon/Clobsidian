## Introduction

Here's a [[backstory on how I've moved over from Clover to Obsidian]]: 

I didn't know how to name this thing so I'll call this vault template Clobsidian (Clover + Obsidian) from this point on. üòú

### üí¨ Yeah Yeah, but I Heard Notion / Remnote / Roam / Capacities / Mem.ai / Loqseq / Reflect / Acreom / Superlist / Cron / Etc. Were Great Alternatives. Why Aren't You Recommending Them Instead?

These [[alternatives apps have frustrated me in one way or another]]. You might also find that there are some compromises you have to make when switching between different apps and workflow

### üí¨ But Really, why Obsidian?

- Open source with a **massive community** behind it
- Use Markdown format
	- **This means it instantly recognizes all our Clover's notes!**
	- Also, because the vault lives in a folder, if one day, say, Obsidian shuts down, your notes will still be accessible, years from now.
- Highly customizable (with plugins)
- Great cost-to-value ratio
	- Main app ‚Üí Free Forever
	- real-time vault sync using cloud services:
		- Official [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) and pay $8/month
		- Or sync using iCloud, Onedrive, Gdrive, Github, dropbox, etc.

## Will there Be More updates/improvements/bug Fixes for Clobsidian?

I work full-time as a product designer (with pathetic coding skills, as you can see on my Dataview plugin queries üòÇ), and putting together this sample vault has taken me over 90+ hours across days, nights, and those drowsy weekends.

As I use this preset daily, just like you, on our journey, I remain committed to making it even better each day. I'm constantly on the lookout for new plugins, presets, and queries that could bring us even closer to realizing our dream of finally moving on from Clover. So expect this vault to be improved over time ‚åõ

**Thank you for giving this a try.**
