## Introduction

Here's a [[backstory on how I've moved over from Clover to Obsidian]]: 

I didn't know how to name this thing so I'll call this vault template Clobsidian (Clover + Obsidian) from this point on. üòú

### Yeah Yeah, but I Heard Notion / Remnote / Roam / Capacities / Mem.ai / Loqseq / Reflect / Acreom / Superlist / Cron / Etc. were Great Alternatives. Why Aren't You Recommending Them Instead?

These [[alternatives apps have frustrated me in one way or another]]. You might also find that there are some compromises you have to make when switching between different apps and workflow

### But Really, why Obsidian?

- Open source with a **massive community** behind it
- Use Markdown format
	- **This means it instantly recognizes all our Clover's notes!**
	- Also, because the vault lives in a folder, if one day, say, Obsidian shuts down, your notes will still be accessible, years from now.
- Highly customizable (with plugins)
- Great cost-to-value ratio
	- Main app ‚Üí Free Forever
	- real-time vault sync using cloud services:
		- Official [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) and pay $8/month
		- Or sync using iCloud, Onedrive, Gdrive, Github, dropbox, etc.

# Because I'm daily driving this preset alongside my own vault. I'll keep improving and keep a look out for any new plugins/preset/query that might help us get closer to our goals of fully transitioning from Clover.

Keep an eye on any updates on my [Github repository](https://github.com/smokebacon/Clobsidian/tree/main)

Thanks for reading and trying this vault out.

I work full-time and this vault takes ~80 hours to put together on weekends alone.

If this made your day of moving away from Clover a tad bit easier. Feel free to leave me a tip and made my day üòÅ
