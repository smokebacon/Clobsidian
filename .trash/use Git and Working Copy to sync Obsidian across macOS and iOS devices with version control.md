## This is optional in case you don't wanna commit to [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) for $8/month
Trust me, the hoops that you have to went through is much, much more headache inducing than just to support the creator of this awesome ecosystem!

Anyway here's the steps to sync your obsidian Vault without iCloud or:

1. Set up github repository of your Obsidian vault
	- [Managing your personal access tokens - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)

2. set up git sync plugin on MacOS
	- [Getting Started - Git Documentation - Obsidian Publish](https://publish.obsidian.md/git-doc/Getting+Started)
	- [[git in windows doesn't work well with question mark signs in file name]] (causes errors)
	- vault-stats.json always causing conflict, is it okay to just ignore and auto-merge that file?

3. Set up Auto pull & Commit on iOS devices using `Working Copy`
