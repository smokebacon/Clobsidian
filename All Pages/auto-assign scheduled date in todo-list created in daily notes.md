One of the `Tasks plugin` settings is that it can auto-detect the name of the document and try to parse it as a date.

This makes it so that any checkbox list will have an auto-assign `âŒ›scheduled` date when querying with `dataview` by default. So that we don't have to tediously assign all to-do items in daily notes with a date.
