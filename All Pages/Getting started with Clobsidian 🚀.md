## What's up with This Weird Name?

I didn't know how to name this thing so I'll call this vault template **Clobsidian** (Clover + Obsidian) from this point on. üòú

### Introduction

If you're interested here's a [[backstory on how I've moved over from Clover to Obsidian]].

### What Plugins Did You Use for All This?

Check out the [[list of community plugins used to simulate clover app functionality]] on the other page.

#### Yeah Yeah, but I Heard Notion / Remnote / Roam / Capacities / Mem.ai / Loqseq / Reflect / Acreom / Superlist / Cron / Etc. Were Great Alternatives. Why Aren't You Recommending Them Instead?

These [[alternatives apps have frustrated me in one way or another]]. You might also find that there are some compromises you have to make when switching between different apps and workflow

## FAQs (WIP)

I'll keep updating this section for any common issues or questions you may have asked.

In the meantime, feel free to drop any comments you have on the Clover app Slack channel or my email below üëá

## Will There Be More updates/improvements/bug Fixes for Clobsidian?

I work full-time as a product designer (with pathetic coding skills, as you can see on my `Dataview` plugin queries üòÇ), and putting together this sample vault has taken me over 90+ hours across days, nights, and those drowsy weekends.

As I use this preset daily, just like you, on our journey, I remain committed to making it even better each day. I'm constantly on the lookout for new plugins, presets, and queries that could bring us even closer to realizing our dream of finally moving on from Clover. So expect this vault to be improved over time ‚åõ
