I've been a dedicated [Clover](https://cloverapp.com/) user for the past 1.5 years before its shutdown announcement, using it daily. 

After extensive research and over 50 hours of trying to replicate my Clover workflow, I found my way here. This is now my new hub for day-to-day task management, note-taking, and knowledge management.

Even though there's still something it can't do e.g. [[surface feature cannot be replaced by Obsidian]] this workspace has a curated [[list of community plugins used to simulate clover app functionality]] that I have relied on my day-to-day. Which is what makes the transition possible.
