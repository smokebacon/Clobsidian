Here is the list of the plugin used to simulate #cloverapp feature:

- [Dataview](obsidian://show-plugin?id=table-editor-obsidian) 
	- This is mainly to create a 'database' of notes within the [[Obsidian's vault]] and allow us to query and quickly jump to any tasks like Clover's tasks rollover feature.
	- Some pinned menus also utilized a table format to display information based on what we could've had on Clover as well 

- [Outliner](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-outliner)
	- Enhance the functionality of Obsidian's outlining-related hotkey and indentation behavior (tab once and move all children along with parent, etc.)
	- Not really mandatory but a great quality-of-life improvement. However, if it's causing some bugs on your end it is safe to remove.

- [Actions URI](obsidian://show-plugin?id=actions-uri)
	- Used solely to allow deep linking into obsidian-specific functions like `Jump to the current date daily note` ![[open-daily-note-quick-command.png]]

- [Advanced Tables](obsidian://show-plugin?id=table-editor-obsidian)
	- Display a better-looking table in [[Edit mode]]

- [Calendar](obsidian://show-plugin?id=calendar)[^1]
	- A calendar view within a window pane (a daily note will be created on the date once clicked)

- [Tasks](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-tasks-plugin) 
	- enable [[cancelled status in checkboxes]]
	- [[auto-assign scheduled date in todo-list created in daily notes]]
	- beautify in-line metadata like `due::` into something more scannable like âŒ› emoji (and have dataview recognize those signifiers)

- [Natural language date](obsidian://show-plugin?id=nldates-obsidian)
	- To enable @ style date assign (with relative time eg. Today, Yesterday)
	- Use to [[assign anything on any pages to have it show up on your daily notes]]

- [Highlighter](obsidian://show-plugin?id=highlightr-plugin)
	- Simulate highlighting color customization using right click or hotkey (albeit harder to controls)
