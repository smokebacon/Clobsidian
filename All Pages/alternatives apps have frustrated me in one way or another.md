- [Loqseq](https://logseq.com/)
	- 90/10/0 → Note/Todo/calendar
	- ✅ Powerful outliner, zoom into any object and topic. You'll get full context wherever your notes are. Everything you do is an outline.
	- ❌ Checklist needs to be wrapped in specific keywords
	- ❌ No reminder feature?
	- ❌ Couldn't find a daily note
	- 🤔 Complex controls for some simple usability


- [Mem.ai](https://mem.ai/) 
	- 50/25/25 → Note/Todo/Calendar
	- 🤔 Aims to be your single base of operations for your day-to-day
	- ❌ Dashboard is more of a journal style. (e.g. Tag inside a document won’t get highlighted in a note and so on)
	- ✅ Useful tasks page with a functional rollover feature
		- No subtask or container description ![[Mem-app-task-view-inside.png|300]]![[mem-app-task-view-outside.png|400]]
	- ✅ Seems to be a lot more context-aware once the AI is enabled (paid plan)
	- 🤔 Maybe this can be an alternative to the default note-taking app?

- [Reflect.app](https://reflect.app/) 
	- ❌ **Not free ($10/month)**
	- ❌ Performance is bad
	- ❌ No easy way to store hashtags

- [Amplenote](https://www.amplenote.com/)
	- 80/20 Notetaker / Task Manager
	- 🤔 Separated task, notes, and calendar. So not sure what’s the point…

- [routine](https://www.routine.co/)  
	- ❌ Stuck in the early access queue since April...

- [Acreom](http://acreom.com) 
	- 80/20 Task Manager / Notetaker
	- ✅ Developers and community is really responsive
	- ✅ Has rollover tasks
	- ❌ Sub-task only goes 1 level deep and does not surface
	- 🤔 Task-oriented style is not going very well with how I freehand ideas and create tasks.

- [ClickUp](https://clickup.com/) 
	- 60/40 Task manager / Notetaker
	- ✅ Flexible project manager for day-to-day
	- ❌ Web-based interface is often laggy
	- ❌ Hard to set up and use
	- ❌ Deteriorating development, lingering issues around the community

- [Noteplan](https://noteplan.co/)
	- 50/50 Task manager / Notetaker
	- ✅ Works well with Apple Calendar
	- ✅ The timeline view is very easy to use
	- ❌ Time-blocking is not working on Outlook
	- 🤔 No freeflow notetaking and linking
	- A bit similar to Agenda but requires so much manual work

- [Akiflow](https://akiflow.com/)
	- 90/10 Task manager / Notetaker
	- It doesn’t sync with Outlook…

- [Remnote](https://www.remnote.com/)
	- 70/30 Notetaker / Task manager
	- 🤔 Daily note doesn’t roll over. Has to filter completed checklist manually
	- ✅ Seems to work and fit most of my needs (very similar to how clover works!)
	- The learning curve is sooo steep! Really hard to wrap your head around its jargon (like Rem!)

- [Craft](https://www.craft.do/)
	- 70/30 Notetaker / Task manager
	- ❌ Exclusive to MacOS & iOS
	- ✅ Great tag support
	- 🤔 Has daily note (but no rollover)
	- ❌ Not a great task manager (not collecting any todos, no task aggregator)
	- ✅ Note feature is on par with notion

- [Superlist](https://www.superlist.com/)
	- 80/20 Task manager / Notetaker
	- ✅ The most comparable to Clover feature: Versatile and freeform Note→Task→Note workflow
	- ✅ Designed with search and tags in mind
	- ❌ Still unstable and laggy sometimes (just beta)
	- ❌ Cannot view subtasks outside its own file
	- ❌ No indentation on aggregated tasks

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/product)
	- 30/40/40 Hype / Task manager / Notetaker
	- ✅ Powerful note taker, reminders, database handler
	- ✅ Has all the functionality (providing you have time to set it up)
	- ❌ The most unintuitive task manager (spends 90% of the time setting up things)
	- ❌ Not a fun 'second brain' user experience like obsidian:
		- ❌ no excessive mention of keywords (because it counts towards the backlink amount and will mess things up)
		- ❌ cannot create empty backlinks while writing. This completely obliterates the train of thoughts
	- ✅ Linking tasks and syncing todos will be easier (with sync block, database inline edit)
	- ❌ No way to aggregate tasks into 1 page → Will have to create 1 database for all the tasks and display that on the daily note and project landing page as a shortcut
	- ❌ The way task and subtask work is so unnatural for someone coming from an outliner
		- Hard to freely note down things and morph into another type.
		- Have to stop and think about what/where/how/why and *then* find the correct places for it.

- [cron](https://cron.com/)
	- 80/20/0 Calendar / Task manager / Notetaker
	- ❌ Not integrated with Outlook
	- 🤔 Rely on notion for its note → Will this create friction?

- [Capacities](https://capacities.io/)
	- 90/10 Notetaker / Task Manager
	- ✅ Real-world-based objects in Capacities is very intuitive and easy to configure and use
	- ✅ Easy to learn and understand
	- ✅ Tasks and subtasks show up when reference
	- ✅ Growing & active community
	- ❌ No rollover and tasks manager feature
